Sales Analysis for Value Inc: Weâ€™re going to be working on a Sales Analysis for a popular retail company called Value Inc.
Here we use Python for the following to clean our data and we use popular libraries like pandas and learn how to work with dataframes, perform calculations and much more. 
We are then going to extract that data to Tableau where we learn how to create calculations, parameters and develop a dashboard for the sales manager.
